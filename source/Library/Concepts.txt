1. A workflow can have several WorkflowSteps
2. Each step can have several actions
3. There in one current active step
4. Out of the actions in a step which is available can be determined at runtime by calling PreActionValidationResult 
5. A selected action can be invoked by calling ExecuteAction delegate internally

7. Orchastrator loads the workflow from a json file by loading WorkflowConfiguration
8. Orchastrator also can save the workflow state in a workflow state object
9. Orhcstrator can also load the workflow state from a workflow state object
10. Orchastrator can also save the workflow state in a json string/stream
11. WorkflowConfigurarion contains design time info and workflow state contains runtime state
12. A workflow can have variables defined at designtime or runtime and their state can change at runtime
13. A WorkflowStep has parameters which are design time variables
14. A WorkflowStep has runtime variables. Runtime variables in workflow step are not saved
